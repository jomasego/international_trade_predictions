## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Options

You have two options for deploying this application:

### Option 1: Full Web Application with Integrated AI Assistant

This option gives you the complete Trade Flow Predictor application with the AI Assistant directly integrated into the application interface.

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jomasego/international_trade_predictions.git
   cd international_trade_predictions/comtrade_predictions
   ```

2. **Set up environment variable:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Hugging Face API token:
   ```
   HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
   This token is required to access the Google Gemma-2b model via Hugging Face Inference API.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch the app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
   - Navigate to the AI Assistant tab to interact with the integrated assistant

### Option 2: Standalone AI Trade Assistant on Hugging Face Space

This option deploys just the AI Assistant component as a separate application on Hugging Face Spaces. This is useful if you only want to provide the AI Assistant functionality without the full application.

1. **Use our existing space:**
   - Visit [AI Trade Assistant](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jomasego/ai-trade-assistant) to use the pre-deployed version

2. **OR deploy your own space:**

   a. **Create a new Space** on Hugging Face with the Flask SDK

   b. **Upload the files from the `clean-space` directory:**
      - `app.py`
      - `requirements.txt`
      - `templates/index.html`

   c. **Set up environment variable:**
      - Add `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN` to your space under Settings > Repository Secrets

   d. **Your space will automatically deploy** and be accessible through the provided URL

### Option 3: Automatic GitHub Actions Deployment

This project is configured to automatically deploy to Hugging Face Spaces using GitHub Actions:

1. **One-time setup:**
   - Add required secrets to your GitHub repository:
     - `HF_TOKEN`: Your Hugging Face API token
     - `SPACE_NAME`: Your desired Space name
     - `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN`: Same as your HF_TOKEN

2. **Automatic deployment:**
   - Every push to the `main` branch triggers a deployment
   - Your app will be available at: `https://huggingface.co/spaces/jomasego/[SPACE_NAME]`

3. **Manual triggering:**
   - You can also manually trigger deployment from the GitHub Actions tab

### Using the AI Assistant

Regardless of which deployment option you choose:

1. Navigate to the AI Assistant interface
2. Type your trade-related question in the chat input
3. Use specialized features:
   - HS Code Lookup: Get detailed explanations of HS codes
   - Trade Recommendations: Receive insights on trade patterns based on countries or product categories
